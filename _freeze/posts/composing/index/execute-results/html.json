For example:\n\n    posts\n    └───composing \n    └───bruin < new folder\n    └───quarto\n    └───software\n    └───welcome\n\n## Create the File\nYou have two options with the folder `bruin/`.\n\nOption 1: Add a Jupyter Notebook named `index.ipynb`\nSince your homework posts will be based on previous work you did in a Jupyter notebook or Google colab, this will probably be the easier option for publishing homeworks.\n\nOption 2: Add a `index.qmd` text file\nBut this is probably a better option for your group project blog post, and once you (hopefully) continue to build up your portfolio using this website.\n\nFor either options, make sure to add a header that looks like this to the top:\n\n    ---\n    title: \"Creating posts\"\n    author: \"Seyoon\"\n    date: \"2023-12-23\"\n    categories: [week 0, example]\n    ---\n\nIn Jupyter notebook, this header should be in a `raw` cell up top.\n\n## Markdown Styling\nYou can use Markdown to style basic text, much as you do in Jupyter Notebooks.\n\nLook into Quarto’s [Markdown basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html), [Figures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html) and [Tables](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html). You’re welcome to explore other pages that cover more complex concepts like [Diagrams](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html), [Videos](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/videos.html), and [Callout Blocks](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html).\n\n## Math\n\nIf you are familiar with the $$\\LaTeX$$ typesetting system, \nyou can use many standard commands by enclosing them in double $ symbols. You can make both inline math like\n$$\nf(x) = e^x\n$$\nand display math like\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{i^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}.\n$$\n\n## Images\nYou can and should include images in your posts, especially in cases where you have created a data visualization. If the image is already available online, you can link to it using the syntax `![alt text](image_url)`:\n\n![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png)\n\n(Source: [https://xkcd.com/353/](https://xkcd.com/353))\n\n## Code\nThere are two main ways to insert code in your posts. When talking about a short concept, like the `np.random.rand()` function, you can type back ticks like this: \\`np.random.rand()\\`.\n\nTo create a larger block of code, use three consecutive backticks ``` to both open and close the code block. If you place the word “{python}” immediately after the opening code blocks, you’ll get attractive syntax highlighting:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef f(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    A cool function that multiples an input x by 2. \n    \"\"\"\n    return 2*x\n\ny = f(3)\nprint(y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n6\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNot only that, once you __render__ the page with Quarto, the code output will show up below. If that’s not what you want, use the word “python” instead of “{python}”\n\nLook at this other cool example from the [Quarto tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/jupyter.html).\n\nFor a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see [Figure 1](https://pic16b-kose.github.io/posts/composing/#fig-polar).\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){width=450 height=439}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFigure 1: A line plot on a polar axis\n\n",
