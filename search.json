Depending on the homework, you must submit a single Python file (.py) or a compressed .zip file containing multiple code files to the “autograder” submission window. For future homework, the autograder task will be a part of the main programming task. For this one, let’s just do a simple PIC 16A-level task. Remember that for your blog post to be graded, you must first pass the autograder. I strongly encourage you to do so a few days before the deadline. You have an unlimited number of submissions to the autograder.\n\nProblem. Define make_count_dictionary in HW0.py\nIn a separate file named HW0.py (please do not use a different name), write the function make_count_dictionary that takes a list L and returns a dictionary D where:\n\nThe keys of D are the unique elements of L (i.e., each element of L appears only once).\nThe value D[i] is the number of times that i appears in list L.\n\nYour code should work for lists of strings, lists of integers, and lists containing both strings and integers.\nFor example:\n# input\nL = [\"a\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n# output\n{\"a\" : 2, \"b\" : 1, \"c\" : 1}\nFor this homework, you don’t need to mention this task in your blog."

Install and Configure Anaconda\nAn important part of PIC16B is navigating the Python package ecosystem.\n https://xkcd.com/1987/\nWe will do so using the Anaconda distribution of Python. Getting set up with Anaconda is a somewhat detailed process, outlined below.\nYou should follow these instructions even if you already have Anaconda installed. Uninstalling and reinstalling is recommended.\n\na. Install Anaconda\nYou can find installers for Anaconda here. Choose the one appropriate to your operating system.\nIf installing on macOS, do not install Anaconda in the root-level opt directory. It is recommended that you install in the folder directly under your username. This is the same folder in which your “Downloads” folder exists. In some cases, Anaconda may suggest installing in a folder called opt under your username; this is fine.\n\n\n\nA screencap of the Anaconda graphical installer. The prompt states ‘You have chosen to install this software in the folder philchodrow on the disk Macintosh HD’\n\n\nExample of installing Anaconda to the directory corresponding to your username.\n\n\nb. Create the PIC16B-24F Anaconda Environment\nWe will create PIC16B-24F anaconda environment with specific package versions. They are listed in a .yml file, depending on OS. We will fix the versions of the following python and other packages throughout the quarter:\n\npython=3.11.6\nnb_conda=2.2.1\nnb_conda_kernels=2.3.1\npandas=2.0.3\nmatplotlib=3.7.2\nscikit-learn=1.3.0\nseaborn=0.12.2\nplotly=5.18.0\nscrapy=2.8.0\ntwisted=22.10.0\nflask=3.0.0\njinja2=3.1.2\njupyter_client=7.4.9\njupyter_core=5.3.0\njupyter_server=1.23.4\njupyterlab=3.6.3\nnotebook=6.5.4\n\nDownload PIC16B-24F-&lt;os&gt;.yml file corresponding to your OS and run the following from the Anaconda Prompt from the directory where the file is located:\nconda env create -f PIC16B-24F-&lt;os&gt;.yml\nThis will create a new environment PIC16B-24F, and I will use that environment in the lectures. Full environment for each OS:\n\nWindows\nMac M1/M2\nLinux\nGeneric – e.g., Mac with Intel chip (sorry, I no longer own one). You may want to change conda’s environment solver to mamba for faster installation.\n\nNote that an autograder will be in use for this course, set up on Ubuntu Linux.\n\nInstalling additional packages\nWe will mainly be using the PIC16B-24F environment throughout the course – changing package versions unless prompted is discouraged. In the future, if you ever attempt to import a package and encounter an error, you may attempt to install it via the Environments tab on Anaconda Navigator. Click on Channels button and add “conda-forge” channel. Then, search for the package you need on the right-hand side (you may need to update the index).\nCheck the box beside this package, and then click “Apply” to install.\nIn this course, we’ll primarily demonstrate deep learning libraries (e.g., Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch) using Google Colab, which has some significant benefits related to speed of computation. However, you can also try to install these packages via the package manager.\nNote: If you want to use command lines to install Python packages in the future, try to follow prompts that look like\nconda activate PIC16B-24F\nconda install --channel=conda-forge &lt;package name&gt;\nrather than the ones that start with pip install. If this sentence didn’t make sense to you, you can ignore it and stick to using Anaconda navigator.\n\n\n\nd. Launch JupyterLab\nNow launch Anaconda Navigator and open the “Home” tab. Launch JupyterLab. Select the environment PIC16B-24F.\n Selecting the PIC16B-24F environment on Anaconda Navigator\nCreate a new Jupyter notebook. Change the kernel to the PIC16B-24F environment that you created in Step 1b.\n Selecting the PIC16B-24F environment from within a Jupyter notebook.\n\n\ne. Verify\nType the two lines below into your blank Jupyter Notebook and run them, adding in your name. If you do not encounter an error, then your setup was successful. Otherwise, contact the instructor or TA for help.\nimport pandas as pd\nprint(\"My name is [your name] and I installed Anaconda\")\n\n\nf. Creating a new environment on Anaconda (optional)\nSometimes, especially for the term project, you may want to use an environment other than what we have set up for the lectures. You can follow the step below to create a “fresh” environment.\n\nOpen Anaconda Navigator.\nNavigate to the Environments tab.\nChoose “Create.”\nCreate a Python 3.11 environment named “PIC16B-project”."

Some people also use Notepad++ but that might not be the best option for beginners. Beyond this course, if you expect to write a significant amount of code in your career then it is worthwhile to find a text editor that you like.\nOnce you’ve installed a text editor that you like, try opening it up and modifying a text file.\nNext, try writing a simple Python file and running it from your editor. To do this, first paste the following into a file called my_script.py:\nprint(\"I can run Python scripts from my text editor!\")\nThen, open a terminal window from your editor. In the terminal, write python3 my_script.py and hit enter. You’ll need to ensure that your terminal is in the same location as the file my_script.py."

When talking about a short concept, like the np.random.rand() function, you can type back ticks like this: `np.random.rand()`.\nTo create a larger block of code, use three consecutive backticks ``` to both open and close the code block. If you place the word “{python}” immediately after the opening code blocks, you’ll get attractive syntax highlighting:\n\ndef f(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    A cool function that multiples an input x by 2. \n    \"\"\"\n    return 2*x\n\ny = f(3)\nprint(y)\n\n6\n\n\nNot only that, once you render the page with Quarto, the code output will show up below. If that’s not what you want, use the word “python” instead of “{python}”\nLook at this other cool example from the Quarto tutorial.\nFor a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see Figure 1.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A line plot on a polar axis"
